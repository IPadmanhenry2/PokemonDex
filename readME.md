# PokemonDex
Hi im Gian 
Im a big Pokemon TCG fan but i also like coding! But im very bad at coding so i used ChatGPT
I wouldt be very happy if someone (a german guy would be perfect) gives me an idea for updates
But now lets go to the code
I made the Script in HTML 
I used the: Pokeapi to show there name and other infos.
            CardmarketAPI to show the selected pokemons cards and prices


# Updates you can do
Attention!
Remind that the PokemonDex is made for german people!
